# vufuse2fs
vufuse module for ext2/ext3/ext4 file systems.

Based on `misc/fuse2fs.c` in [e2fsprogs](http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net)

`vufuse2fs` is reentrant: the module can be used to mount several file systems.

This source tree also creates `refuse2fs`, a FUSE module equivalent to
`fuse2fs`, generated by modified code for reentrancy.

`vufuse2fs` and `refuse2fs` do not support journal recovery during the mount
operation. In this case, a separate `e2fsck -E journal_only` command is
required.

## Download, Compile and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/virtualsquare/vufuse2fs.git
```

It uses `cmake`, so the following sequence of commands can be used to compile and install
`vufuse2fs`:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

An uninstall procedure is also available:
```
sudo make uninstall
```

## Example:

In a VUOS session, add the `vufuse module`
```
vu_insmod vufuse
```
and then mount an ext 2/3/4 disk image. in the following example the file `/tmp/e2disk`
on the mountpoint `/tmp/mnt`.
```
vumount -t vufuse2fs /tmp/e2disk /tmp/mnt
```

Use `vuumount /tmp/mnt` to unmount the archive.
